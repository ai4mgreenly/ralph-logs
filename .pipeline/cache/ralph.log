Goal

Create a file named `PING.md` in the root of the repository with the content `PONG` (just the word, nothing else).

Iteration 1

Dirty working copy detected and committed, use `jj diff -r pqwmmmvwxtkk` to see the changes.

Iteration 2

? system (+3s / 3s)

I need to create a file named `PING.md` in the repository root containing exactly `PONG` followed by a newline. Let me first check if this file already exists, then create it. (+7s / 11s) [5.9%]

→ Bash command="ls -la PING.md 2>&1 || echo "File does not ex...", description="Check if PING.md already exists" (+0s / 11s)

← Bash stdout="ls: cannot access 'PING.md': No such file or ...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 12s)

→ Write file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., content=PONG (+3s / 16s)

← Write type=create, filePath=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., content=PONG, structuredPatch=[], originalFile= (+0s / 16s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a... (+2s / 19s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/r... (+0s / 19s)

→ Bash command="git status --short", description="Check git status to verify only PING.md was a..." (+4s / 23s)

← Bash stdout="A .pipeline/cache/goal-progress.jsonl A .pipe...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 24s)

Perfect! I have successfully completed the objective:

1. Created `PING.md` in the repository root
2. The file contains exactly `PONG` followed by a newline
3. No other files were modified (the `.pipeline/cache` files were already staged from the previous iteration)

The file is now present and verified with the correct content. (+5s / 29s) [6.5%]

→ StructuredOutput summary=DONE (+0s / 30s)

← StructuredOutput  (+0s / 30s)


✓ DONE
